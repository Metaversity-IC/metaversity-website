# Intelligent Economics: An Explainable Approach

Let's make economics intelligent again!

## About

This course explores the interdisciplinary conversation between economics and artificial intelligence (AI). In experiential education, this course shows how the two disciplines advance each other by an explainable AI approach: economics makes AI more explainable by clarifying causal relationships, and AI empowers economic applications by increasing efficiency. Advanced research in Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Behavioral and Experimental Economics is covered with both a general literature review and a case study. The course concludes with a research proposal where students propose an executive plan for academic research and automated products collaboratively in a team of economists, data scientists, and data engineers. Instructor: [Dr. Luyao Zhang](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/luyao.zhang), Assistant Professor of Economics at Social Science Division and Senior Research Scientist at Data Science Research Center, Duke Kunshan University.
